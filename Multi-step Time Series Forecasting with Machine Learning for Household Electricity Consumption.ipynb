    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Household Power Consumption](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption) dataset is a multivariate time series dataset that describes the electricity consumption for a single household over four years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected between December 2006 and November 2010 and observations of power consumption within the household were collected every minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a multivariate series comprised of seven variables (besides the date and time); they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **global_active_power**: The total active power consumed by the household (kilowatts).\n",
    "- **global_reactive_power**: The total reactive power consumed by the household (kilowatts).\n",
    "- **voltage**: Average voltage (volts).\n",
    "- **global_intensity**: Average current intensity (amps).\n",
    "- **sub_metering_1**: Active energy for kitchen (watt-hours of active energy).\n",
    "- **sub_metering_2**: Active energy for laundry (watt-hours of active energy).\n",
    "- **sub_metering_3**: Active energy for climate control systems (watt-hours of active energy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Active and reactive energy refer to the technical details of alternative current.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fourth sub-metering variable can be created by subtracting the sum of three defined sub-metering variables from the total active energy as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sub_metering_remainder = (global_active_power * 1000 / 60) - (sub_metering_1 + sub_metering_2 + sub_metering_3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load and Prepare Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning repository as a single 20 megabyte .zip file:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [household_power_consumption.zip](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00235/household_power_consumption.zip)\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the dataset and unzip it into your current working directory. You will now have the file *household_power_consumption.txt* that is about 127 megabytes in size and contains all of the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the *read_csv()* function to load the data and combine the first two columns into a single date-time column that we can use as an index.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will consider how we can develop and evaluate predictive models for the household power dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is divided into four parts; they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Problem Framing\n",
    "1. Evaluation Metric\n",
    "1. Train and Test Sets\n",
    "1. Walk-Forward Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Framing\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to harness and explore the household power consumption dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "we will use the data to explore a very specific question; that is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given recent power consumption, what is the expected power consumption for the week ahead?\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires that a predictive model forecast the total active power for each day over the next seven days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, this framing of the problem is referred to as a multi-step time series forecasting problem, given the multiple forecast steps. A model that makes use of multiple input variables may be referred to as a multivariate multi-step time series forecasting model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model of this type could be helpful within the household in planning expenditures. It could also be helpful on the supply side for planning electricity demand for a specific household.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framing of the dataset also suggests that it would be useful to downsample the per-minute observations of power consumption to daily totals. This is not required, but makes sense, given that we are interested in total power per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can achieve this easily using the [resample()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.resample.html) function on the pandas DataFrame. Calling this function with the argument ‘D‘ allows the loaded data indexed by date-time to be grouped by day ([see all offset aliases](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/timeseries.html#offset-aliases)). We can then calculate the sum of all observations for each day and create a new dataset of daily power consumption data for each of the eight variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete example is listed below."

    "\n",
    "We can use this as the dataset for fitting and evaluating predictive models for the chosen framing of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "A forecast will be comprised of seven values, one for each day of the week ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common with multi-step forecasting problems to evaluate each forecasted time step separately. This is helpful for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To comment on the skill at a specific lead time (e.g. +1 day vs +3 days).\n",
    "\n",
    "- To contrast models based on their skills at different lead times (e.g. models good at +1 day vs models good at days +5).\n",
    "\n",
    "The units of the total power are kilowatts and it would be useful to have an error metric that was also in the same units. Both Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) fit this bill, although RMSE is more commonly used and will be adopted in this tutorial. Unlike MAE, RMSE is more punishing of forecast errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance metric for this problem will be the RMSE for each lead time from day 1 to day 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a short-cut, it may be useful to summarize the performance of a model using a single score in order to aide in model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible score that could be used would be the RMSE across all forecast days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function *evaluate_forecasts()* below will implement this behavior and return the performance of a model based on multiple seven-day forecasts.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# evaluate one or more weekly forecasts against expected values\n",
    "def evaluate_forecasts(actual, predicted):\n",
    "    scores = list()\n",
    "    # calculate an RMSE score for each day\n",
    "    for i in range(actual.shape[1]):\n",
    "        # calculate mse\n",
    "        mse = mean_squared_error(actual[:, i], predicted[:, i])\n",
    "        # calculate rmse\n",
    "        rmse = sqrt(mse)\n",
    "        # store\n",
    "        scores.append(rmse)\n",
    "    # calculate overall RMSE\n",
    "    s = 0\n",
    "    for row in range(actual.shape[0]):\n",
    "        for col in range(actual.shape[1]):\n",
    "            s += (actual[row, col] - predicted[row, col])**2\n",
    "    score = sqrt(s / (actual.shape[0] * actual.shape[1]))\n",
    "    return score, scores\n",

    "Running the function will first return the overall RMSE regardless of day, then an array of RMSE scores for each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train and Test Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the first three years of data for training predictive models and the final year for evaluating models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in a given dataset will be divided into standard weeks. These are weeks that begin on a Sunday and end on a Saturday.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a realistic and useful way for using the chosen framing of the model, where the power consumption for the week ahead can be predicted. It is also helpful with modeling, where models can be used to predict a specific day (e.g. Wednesday) or the entire sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will split the data into standard weeks, working backwards from the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final year of the data is in 2010 and the first Sunday for 2010 was January 3rd. The data ends in mid November 2010 and the closest final Saturday in the data is November 20th. This gives 46 weeks of test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and last rows of daily data for the test dataset are provided below for confirmation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The daily data starts in late 2006.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first Sunday in the dataset is December 17th, which is the second row of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizing the data into standard weeks gives 159 full standard weeks for training a predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function split_dataset() below splits the daily data into train and test sets and organizes each into standard weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific row offsets are used to split the data using knowledge of the dataset. The split datasets are then organized into weekly data using the NumPy split() function.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# split a univariate dataset into train/test sets\n",
    "def split_dataset(data):\n",
    "\t# split into standard weeks\n",
    "\ttrain, test = data[1:-328], data[-328:-6]\n",
    "\t# restructure into windows of weekly data\n",
    "\ttrain = array(split(train, len(train)/7))\n",
    "\ttest = array(split(test, len(test)/7))\n",
    "\treturn train, test\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can test this function out by loading the daily dataset and printing the first and last rows of data from both the train and test sets to confirm they match the expectations above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the example shows that indeed the train dataset has 159 weeks of data, whereas the test dataset has 46 weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the total active power for the train and test dataset for the first and last rows match the data for the specific dates that we defined as the bounds on the standard weeks for each set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Walk-Forward Validation\n",
    "Models will be evaluated using a scheme called walk-forward validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where a model is required to make a one week prediction, then the actual data for that week is made available to the model so that it can be used as the basis for making a prediction on the subsequent week. This is both realistic for how the model may be used in practice and beneficial to the models, allowing them to make use of the best available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can demonstrate this below with separation of input data and output/predicted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The walk-forward validation approach to evaluating predictive models on this dataset is provided in a function below, named evaluate_model().\n",
    "\n",
    "A scikit-learn model object is provided as an argument to the function, along with the train and test datasets. An additional argument n_input is provided that is used to define the number of prior observations that the model will use as input in order to make a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specifics of how a scikit-learn model is fit and makes predictions is covered in later sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forecasts made by the model are then evaluated against the test dataset using the previously defined evaluate_forecasts() function.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# evaluate a single model\n",
    "def evaluate_model(model, train, test, n_input):\n",
    "\t# history is a list of weekly data\n",
    "\thistory = [x for x in train]\n",
    "\t# walk-forward validation over each week\n",
    "\tpredictions = list()\n",
    "\tfor i in range(len(test)):\n",
    "\t\t# predict the week\n",
    "\t\tyhat_sequence = ...\n",
    "\t\t# store the predictions\n",
    "\t\tpredictions.append(yhat_sequence)\n",
    "\t\t# get real observation and add to history for predicting the next week\n",
    "\t\thistory.append(test[i, :])\n",
    "\tpredictions = array(predictions)\n",
    "\t# evaluate predictions days for each week\n",
    "\tscore, scores = evaluate_forecasts(test[:, :, 0], predictions)\n",
    "\treturn score, scores\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once we have the evaluation for a model we can summarize the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function below, named summarize_scores(), will display the performance of a model as a single line for easy comparison with other models.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# summarize scores\n",
    "def summarize_scores(name, score, scores):\n",
    "\ts_scores = ', '.join(['%.1f' % s for s in scores])\n",
    "\tprint('%s: [%.3f] %s' % (name, score, s_scores))\n",
    "```\n",
    "We now have all of the elements to begin evaluating predictive models on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recursive Multi-Step Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Most predictive modeling algorithms will take some number of observations as input and predict a single output value.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, they cannot be used directly to make a multi-step time series forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "This applies to most linear, nonlinear, and ensemble machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach where machine learning algorithms can be used to make a multi-step time series forecast is to use them recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This involves making a prediction for one time step, taking the prediction, and feeding it into the model as an input in order to predict the subsequent time step. This process is repeated until the desired number of steps have been forecasted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will develop a test harness for fitting and evaluating machine learning algorithms provided in scikit-learn using a recursive model for multi-step forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X = [x1, x2, x3]\n",
    "y1 = model.predict(X)\n",
    " \n",
    "X = [x2, x3, y1]\n",
    "y2 = model.predict(X)\n",
    " \n",
    "X = [x3, y1, y2]\n",
    "y3 = model.predict(X)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to convert the prepared training data in window format into a single univariate series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The to_series() function below will convert a list of weekly multivariate data into a single univariate series of daily total power consumed.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# convert windows of weekly multivariate data into a series of total power\n",
    "def to_series(data):\n",
    "\t# extract just the total power from each week\n",
    "\tseries = [week[:, 0] for week in data]\n",
    "\t# flatten into a single series\n",
    "\tseries = array(series).flatten()\n",
    "\treturn series\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the sequence of daily power needs to be transformed into inputs and outputs suitable for fitting a supervised learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction will be some function of the total power consumed on prior days. We can choose the number of prior days to use as inputs, such as one or two weeks. There will always be a single output: the total power consumed on the next day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will be fit on the true observations from prior time steps. We need to iterate through the sequence of daily power consumed and split it into inputs and outputs. This is called a sliding window data representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *to_supervised()* function below implements this behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes a list of weekly data as input as well as the number of prior days to use as inputs for each sample that is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to convert the history into a single data series. The series is then enumerated, creating one input and output pair per time step. This framing of the problem will allow a model to learn to predict any day of the week given the observations of prior days. The function returns the inputs (X) and outputs (y) ready for training a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# convert history into inputs and outputs\n",
    "def to_supervised(history, n_input):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The scikit-learn library allows a model to be used as part of a pipeline. This allows data transforms to be applied automatically prior to fitting the model. More importantly, the transforms are prepared in the correct way, where they are prepared or fit on the training data and applied on the test data. This prevents data leakage when evaluating models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this capability when in evaluating models by creating a pipeline prior to fitting each model on the training dataset. We will both standardize and normalize the data prior to using the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "The standardization and normalization operations are performed per column. In the to_supervised() function, we have essentially split one column of data (total power) into multiple columns, e.g. seven for seven days of input observations. This means that each of the seven columns in the input data will have a different mean and standard deviation for standardization and a different min and max for normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that we used a sliding window, almost all values will appear in each column, therefore, this is not likely an issue. But it is important to note that it would be more rigorous to scale the data as a single column prior to splitting it into inputs and outputs.\n",

    "An alternate to the recursive strategy for multi-step forecasting is to use a different model for each of the days to be forecasted.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a direct multi-step forecasting strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are interested in forecasting seven days, this would require preparing seven different models, each specialized for forecasting a different day.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two approaches to training such a model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Predict Day.** Models can be prepared to predict a specific day of the standard week, e.g. Monday.\n",
    "- **Predict Lead Time.** Models can be prepared to predict a specific lead time, e.g. day 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting a day will be more specific, but will mean that less of the training data can be used for each model. Predicting a lead time makes use of more of the training data, but requires the model to generalize across the different days of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore both approaches in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Direct Day Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we must update the to_supervised() function to prepare the data, such as the prior week of observations, used as input and an observation from a specific day in the following week used as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The updated to_supervised() function that implements this behavior is listed below. It takes an argument output_ix that defines the day [0,6] in the following week to use as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# convert history into inputs and outputs\n",
    "def to_supervised(history, output_ix):\n",
    "\tX, y = list(), list()\n",
    "\t# step over the entire history one time step at a time\n",

    "\t\ty.append(history[i + 1][output_ix,0])\n",
    "\treturn array(X), array(y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function can be called seven times, once for each of the seven models required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can update the sklearn_predict() function to create a new dataset and a new model for each day in the one-week forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "The body of the function is mostly unchanged, only it is used within a loop over each day in the output sequence, where the index of the day “i” is passed to the call to to_supervised() in order to prepare a specific dataset for training a model to predict that day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function no longer takes an n_input argument, as we have fixed the input to be the seven days of the prior week.\n",

    "- **Nonlinear Algorithms.** Explore a suite of nonlinear and ensemble machine learning algorithms to see if they can lift performance, such as SVM and Random Forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multivariate Direct Models.** Develop direct models that make use of all input variables for the prior week, not just the total daily power consumed. This will require flattening the 2D arrays of seven days of eight variables into 1D vectors."
